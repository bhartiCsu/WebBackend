To run the program:

1. Install IDE of your choice. We have used Visual studio.

2. Install POSTMAN.

3. Clone the repository by executing the following command in your terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/bhartiCsu/WebBackend.git

4. Once the cloning process is completed, a folder named 'WebBackend' will get downloaded in the directory where you ran the git clone command.

5. Open your preferred IDE and import the downloaded project folder into the IDE.

6. Open the 'MidTermProject' folder.

7. Follow the link to get the command to create separate environment in visual studio(IDE):
    https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask
    
    For any other IDE, you can check the respective commands to create an environment for package installation. However it is not manadatory to create an environment. It is recommended though, so as to avoid any version conflicts if you already have installed packages for your another work.

7. Open Requirements.txt file and install the listed packages.

8. Run app.py using command "python -m flask run"


The program will execute and it will show you the http server url. Use that url followed by routes given in app.py and run it on Postman.
